<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>This site is inspired and by Andy Matuschak <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public notes</a>. </p><p>I strive to publish what he calls Evergreen notes. Evergreen notes have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>They are meant to be building blocks that enable you to create larger more complex ideas, ie they are not transient. </li><li>Each evergreen note is about one thing. </li><li>That one thing is a concept or idea (not a place, or an experience, or a book or a person).</li><li>The title should make a definitive claim. The rest of the note merely supports the assertion made in the title. </li><li>Evergreen notes are organised by linking between them, not by a hierarchical table of contents. </li></ul><h2 class="">Why not just write? Why follow this strict algorithm? </h2><p>Note taking is not just about saying what is on our mind. Its also about organising our thoughts better. Because note taking is about thinking better.</p><p>And to think better we need to ensure that our thoughts can be retrieved and assembled together to build new ideas. This enables our thinking to develop faster and in more concrete ways, with more insight and new ideas. </p><p>By structuring our notes as small, reusable blocks, its becomes easier to assemble them later and build bigger ideas. When notes are broad they contain too many different ideas, its then becomes hard to find those ideas and connect them to ideas in other notes. </p><p>By connecting our notes to each other with lots of links we are forced to see how ideas relate to each other. Our notes become a network. Each note gains in relevance based on how it connects to our wider network of notes. </p><p>Having a title that clearly sets our what each note is about, makes it easier to retieive notes and to refer to them in other notes. We can build bigger ideas merely by connecting different note titles. </p><h2 class="">Other notes types </h2><p>Not all notes here are Evergreen notes. Some notes are explanatory (like this one) and therefore dont follow the Evergreen note principles. Other notes play an organising role by simply housing a list of notes based on a topic or idea. </p><p>I might also list some personal projects I've worked on, and maybe some book or article summaries. But the main reason for this site is to publish Evergreen notes.</p><h2 class="">How to navigating</h2><p>There is no table of contents. I do have the above theme notes which are useful. 
This site has a cool feature called <strong>bi-directional linking</strong>. It means that at the bottom of each note you can see all the other notes that link to it. Its useful because you can see where each note was mentioned. The connections matter just as much as the content within the note.  It also gives you another way in which to navigate</p><h2 class="">How this site is built </h2><p>This site is built in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://tiddlywiki.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TiddlyWiki</a>, an opensource wiki platform that is super fun to play with (although it's a bit tricky to learn for non-coders like me). </p><p>I discovered TiddlyWiki through <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://twitter.com/anthilemoon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anne-Laure Le Cunff</a> of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://https://nesslabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ness Labs</a>. Like me, and many others, she was inspired by Andy's notes, and wanted to have her own version. She figured out how to hack TiddlyWiki for this purpose (<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://mentalnodes.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here is her notes site</a>) and then was kind enough to create a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-static-website-generator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> so others could do the same. </p></div>
